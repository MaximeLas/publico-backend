Pro Bono Resource Center of Maryland – Application Attachment
The Pro Bono Resource Center of Maryland (PBRC) engages attorneys to provide free legal help to low-income families, ensuring that they can meet essential needs like food, shelter, employment, and medical care. We work to stop wage garnishments, evictions, foreclosures, denial of benefits, and more. Even though Maryland is one of the wealthiest states in the nation, more than 553,000 Marylanders live below the federal poverty line of less than $25,100 a year for a family of four, according to the Maryland Alliance for the Poor’s 2020 Maryland Poverty Profile. Even more striking, almost half of those living in poverty actually subsist on less than $6,070 a year for one person, meeting the federal definition of “deep poverty.” These families cannot afford a private lawyer—leading to inequities which extend far beyond the courtroom, and disparities in education, wages, home ownership, and wealth. In FY20, PBRC’s work impacted 6,654 low-income individuals with tremendous results. More than 94% of our consumer clients have their debts reduced, dismissed, or settled. We particularly focus on financial literacy and stabilizing individuals and families so they can preserve the few assets they have and avoid the cycle of poverty. Through legal advice clinics in courthouses and low-income communities, we help eliminate systemic abuses in the justice system, provide immediate assistance for those in need, and develop program models that other nonprofits can replicate. 

During and in the aftermath of the current COVID-19 pandemic, our work is more important than ever. We immediately transitioned to remote pro bono legal clinics and are now offering a combination of remote and in-person assistance. These include in-person clinics at the affidavit judgment docket for debt defense in Baltimore City and clinics on the remote Zoom resolution docket in Prince George’s County. Our consumer cases have ticked up noticeably in the past month, and we are seeing a tremendous surge in the need for resolution of debt issues. Since the pandemic began, more than 600,000 people in Maryland have filed for unemployment. A recent report by the Pew Charitable Trust found that most consumer debt stems from job loss, illness, divorce, or some other life event that causes a dramatic change in household income. Nationwide, two in five adults say that they would not have enough cash to cover emergency expenses of $400. While our nation slowly returns to normalcy, many families are struggling with more than a year of lost wages. PBRC is tremendously grateful for the American College of Bankruptcy Foundation’s past generosity. As we continually adapt our service delivery to respond effectively and efficiently to community needs, we request a $10,000 grant to fund work in our Consumer Protection Project (debt defense), including remote and in-person clinics as required by public health mandates, staffing our consumer hotline, development of pro bono opportunities with the US Bankruptcy Court as well as special outreach efforts to recruit volunteer attorneys from among bankruptcy practitioners. 

PBRC’s Consumer Protection Project (CPP) operates in-court and remote docket clinics staffed by PBRC and volunteer attorneys and coordinates pro bono representation for cases that extend beyond the consumer dockets, helping defendants identify and assert defenses, negotiate settlements, and seek more favorable outcomes. PBRC initiated CPP and held the first CPP clinic in February 2012. We currently operate a weekly legal clinic in Baltimore City District Court, along with a clinic in Prince George’s County on the first three Fridays of each month (currently a remote, Zoom docket). Both are coordinated by PBRC staff attorneys who recruit trained volunteer attorneys to provide free legal assistance to consumer defendants who appear in court that day. Due to variations in the affidavit judgment docket procedures in the two jurisdictions, the clinics operate differently in each location. In Baltimore City, volunteers offer one-on-one legal advice, assist consumers with filing Notices of Intention to Defend (NOIDs), and provide limited scope representation during brief “meritorious defense” hearings. In Prince George’s County, volunteers provide one-on-one legal advice and then, if desired, negotiate on behalf of consumers in “resolution conferences” with plaintiffs’ attorneys or assist consumers with filing NOIDs. In both clinics, volunteer attorneys can accept cases not resolved that day on a pro bono basis “on the spot.” Clients whose cases are not accepted that day are provided with referral information to obtain further pro bono assistance, including bankruptcy help when appropriate, and suggested next steps in their case.  

In our experience, the overwhelming number defendants sued under the affidavit judgment process are unrepresented and struggling financially. Indeed, the average CPP client is a female caretaker of minor, senior, and/or disabled dependents; not working full time; with low income and educational levels; and in a household already disrupted by divorce, death, or medical concerns. Typically, defendants receive a notice to appear in court for trial and almost always appear unrepresented. Defendants are often confused about who is suing them, as the plaintiff is usually not to whom they were initially indebted, and unaware of their options for resolution or possible meritorious defenses. Despite the pro se defendant’s best efforts to resolve the case at or before the trial date, a money judgement is often entered. Payment plans and financial or medical hardships are not accepted defenses for dismissal when presented by a pro se defendant. Defendants appearing in consumer court must articulate a legal defense or their case will be reviewed for judgment; and a judgment has devastating consequences. It wrecks the defendant’s credit history and allows the plaintiff to garnish wages to satisfy the debt, often at a much higher rate than if a payment plan had been arranged before judgment was entered. Applying for loans, buying a home or car, or even renting an apartment becomes nearly impossible. Filing for bankruptcy, or avoiding bankruptcy are important considerations for the clients and need to be explained by knowledgeable counsel.

Reaching potential clients early will be a critical element of the proposed project. Defendants frequently fail to appear in court or appear unprepared and confused. The day the defendant is first summoned to court is their last chance to avoid a judgment. Given this, proactive and preventative efforts can make a drastic difference. PBRC has worked with the courts to include our phone number on the court summons, and we are maintaining a Consumer Hotline to connect with defendants prior to court. Through the Hotline, it may be possible to remove these cases completely from the affidavit judgment docket prior to the initial court date and reset for trial or negotiate settlements. This is a preventative strategy that will build on CPP’s existing clinics. The project serves both the court and the clients; resulting in fewer postponement requests and fewer defendants on the docket, while at the same time benefiting clients who learn their options well before the trial date and most likely achieve a favorable case resolution outside of court. 

While CPP’s success rate is impressive, limited funding threatens this important work. A grant from the American College of Bankruptcy Foundation will enable PBRC to: 
Conduct targeted outreach to bankruptcy and consumer attorneys in an effort to mobilize volunteers to provide pro bono legal assistance, including engagement sessions with the Maryland Bankruptcy Bar Association, Consumer Bankruptcy Section, and US Bankruptcy Court; 
Train volunteer attorneys to supplement its staff and provide legal assistance to consumers sued for outstanding debts.
Operate seven debt defense clinics per month, serving an estimated 450 - 500 clients in FY22: and
Maintain our new Consumer Hotline and offer pre-court resolution where possible.

ACBF funding will allow PBRC to respond to the changing needs and serious impact of the current and future financial downturn on low-to-moderate income residents.
